## Steps to run on your local machine
### Using docker
- Running the app using the docker container is the simplest way to run this app.
- All you need to have is Docker on you system.
- Then go to the root repository of the project containing client folder, server folder, compose.yml, group_music.sql.
- Open the terminal at that location and run the command `docker-compose up`
